## Components and Technology

This is a front-end for Susper running on Yacy server. The retrieval of search results is done using YaCy search API.

* Solr and Javascript(JSON)

Search results are displayed using Solr server which is embedded into YaCy. All search results must be provided by a YaCy search server which includes a Solr with a specialized JSON result writer. When a search request is made in one of the search templates, a http request is made to YaCy. The response is done in JSON because that can much better be parsed than XML in JavaScript. To overcome the same orgin policy in JavaScript, the result is capsuled into a JSONP response.

## Technology Stack
##### Components
* HTML - Structure of the web page generated.
* CSS - Styling options and details ofthe web page.
* Javascript(JSON) - Used to store information for deploying the application such as dependencies.
* Angular-4 - Structure for deployment of the web page.

## Requirements
* [Angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation)
* node --version >= 6
* npm --version >= 3

## Installation
First we will need to install angular-cli by using the following command:
```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```
After installing angular-cli we need to install our required node modules, so we will do that by using the following command:
```sh
$ npm install
```
## How to deploy?
### Running on localhost:
* **Step 1:** Fork susper repository and clone it to your desktop
* **Step 2:** Then cd into that cloned folder
* **Step 3:** Deploy locally by running this :```$ ng serve```
* **Step 4:** Go to localhost:4200 where the application will be running locally.

### For deploying with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):
With these very simple steps you can have susper deployed:

* **Step 1:** Fork susper repository and clone it to your desktop.
* **Step 2:** Then checkout to your master branch `$ git checkout angular`
* **Step 3:** Deploy running this : ```ng build``` and then ```npm run deploy```
* **Step 4:** Visit `https://yourusername.github.io/susper` and you should see the Susper search running.
* **Step 5:** As you search you might see that that it cant find anything, to resolve this, on search you will see there is a red shield on search bar, click on it and allow to load unsafe scripts.
* **Step 6:** Reload and you will have a fully functioning Susper search deployed on github pages.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng g directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng build` and `npm run deploy` to deploy to Susper search on github pages.

## Update Angular-CLI

To update Angular-CLI to a new version, you must update both the global package and your project's local package.

Global package

```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

Local package

```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist # use rmdir /S/Q node_modules dist in Windows Command Prompt; use rm -r -fo node_modules,dist in Windows PowerShell
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
npm install
```
