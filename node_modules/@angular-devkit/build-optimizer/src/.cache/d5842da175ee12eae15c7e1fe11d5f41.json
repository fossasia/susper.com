Each time it observes one of these emitted inner\n * Observables, the output Observable subscribes to the inner Observable and\n * begins emitting the items emitted by that. So far, it behaves\n * like {@link mergeAll}. However, when a new inner Observable is emitted,\n * `switch` unsubscribes from the earlier-emitted inner Observable and\n * subscribes to the new inner Observable and begins emitting items from it. It\n * continues to behave like this for subsequent inner Observables.\n *\n * @example <caption>Rerun an interval Observable on every click event</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * // Each click event is mapped to an Observable that ticks every second\n * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * var switched = higherOrder.switch();\n * // The outcome is that `switched` is essentially a timer that restarts\n * // on every click.
