If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same\n * as the source.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.\n * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`\n * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will\n * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will\n * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive\n * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable\n * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with\n * an error.\n *\n * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not\n * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take\n * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>\n * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)\n *   .map(x => {\n *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }\n         return 10 / x;\n *   })\n *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))\n *   .subscribe(\n *     val => console.log(val),\n *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.\n *     () => console.log('that\\'s it!')\n *   );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 10\n * // 5\n * // 3.3333333333333335\n * // 1\n * // 2\n * // 3\n * // \"that's it!\"\n *\n * @see {@link concat}\n * @see {@link catch}\n *\n * @param {...ObservableInput} observables Observables passed either directly or as an array.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits values from source Observable, but - if it errors - subscribes\n * to the next passed Observable and so on, until it completes or runs out of Observables.\n * @method onErrorResumeNext\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function onErrorResumeNext() {\n    var nextSources = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        nextSources[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    return higherOrder.apply(void 0, nextSources)(this);\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=onErrorResumeNext.js.map\n",null]}
