If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing\n * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.\n *\n * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code\n * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called \"deferring\".\n * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves\n * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.\n *\n * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process\n * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,\n * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but\n * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.\n *\n * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>\n *\n * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...\n * Rx.Scheduler.asap.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"asap\"\n * // \"async\"\n * // ... but 'asap' goes first!\n *\n * @static true\n * @name asap\n * @owner Scheduler\n */\nexports.asap = new AsapScheduler_1.AsapScheduler(AsapAction_1.AsapAction);\n//# sourceMappingURL=asap.js.map",null]}
