If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,\n * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.\n * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment\n * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be\n * emitted within specified period since previous value.\n *\n * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws\n * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between\n * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete\n * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting\n * stream behaves just as source Observable.\n *\n * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)\n * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.\n *\n * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,\n *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.\n * .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.\n *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.\n * );\n *\n * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.\n *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,\n *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.\n * );\n *\n * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds.timeout(new Date(\"December 17, 2020 03:24:00\"))\n * .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would\n *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.\n *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,\n *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.\n * );\n *\n * @see {@link timeoutWith}\n *\n * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values\n *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] Scheduler controlling when timeout checks occur.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that mirrors behaviour of source, unless timeout checks fail.\n * @method timeout\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function timeout(due, scheduler) {\n    if (scheduler === void 0) {\n        scheduler = async;\n    }\n    return higherOrder(due, scheduler)(this);\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=timeout.js.map\n",null]}
